PyBer_Analysis
Overview:
creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type using my Python skills and knowledge of Pandas. then will be creating a multiple line graph with Matplotlib.

Results:
⦁	Rural area had total 25 rides and average fare by ride was $34.62 and average fare by driver was $55.49 shown in Pyber summary. In the line graph, rural area's(shown as yellow) total fares were high in end of February and beginning of March for $2500 and in April the fares were in-between $2000-$2500.
⦁	Suburban area graph (shown in red), the highest fare in-between $1000-$1500 was in month of February and the lowest was in begginning of March and April from $500-$1000. In Pyber summary, Suburban had 625 total rides and 490 total drivers. the fare per ride was $30.97 and average fare by driver was $39.50.
⦁	Urban area (shown as blue in graph), the highest total fare for week was in beginnging of April $500. the total fare by week was mostly high in the mid of month and end of month in-between 0-$500. In Pyber summary, Urban area had the most rides 1625 and total drivers 2405. The average ride fare for Urban area was $24.53 and total fare by driver was $16.57.

Summary:
	Disparity in-between Urban, Suburban and Rural is fare per ride, having too many choices to limited choices of ride, limited resources and distance.
